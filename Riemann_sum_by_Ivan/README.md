# Riemann Sum

A Riemann sum is a certain kind of approximation of an integral by a finite sum. It is named after nineteenth century German mathematician Bernhard Riemann. One very common application is approximating the area of functions or lines on a graph, but also the length of curves and other approximations. The sum is calculated by partitioning the region into shapes (rectangles, trapezoids, parabolas) that together form a region that is similar to the region being measured, then calculating the area for each of these shapes and adding all these small areas together to get an approximation of the total area

In this approximation method, we use the function

$
f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^2}
$

Then taking a small $dx$

we integrate $f(x)$ function from 0 to 1.
